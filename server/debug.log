Far from fostering democracy and social justice, foreign loans and aid were major impediments to these ideals. Symptomatic of systematic underdevelopment, cyclical Third World foreign borrowing and debt crises have been responsible for maintaining the debtor nations integrated into the global market economy, perpetuating their dependency, and maintaining low living standards. Comparing Colombia and Chile, the book examines the complex factors of domestic and international forces that account for structural underdevelopment in the Third World. A study on the historical antecedents of globalism and its impact on the Third World, this book analyzes the interplay between IMF, World Bank, and U.S. foreign policy in shaping the economies of the Third World through loans that are the catalyst to global integration. Through its in-depth look at a complex topic, this book will prove provocative and valuable reading to students of globalization, inter-American relations, international finance, Latin American History, and U.S. diplomatic history.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780313012181"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0313012180"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":257,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["History"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.0.1.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WbDOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WbDOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WbDOEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA190&dq=sddf&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WbDOEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WbDOEAAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"NL","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":86.25,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amount":60.37,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WbDOEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-WbDOEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":86250000,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":60370000,"currencyCode":"EUR"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"NL","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.nl/books/download/The_Sword_of_Damocles-sample-pdf.acsm?id=WbDOEAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=WbDOEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"... <b>SDDF</b> 821.10 / 6-756 , no . 865 . 32.

Drawing on extensive archival research in Mexico, the United States, and Great Britain, Christy Thornton meticulously traces how Mexican officials repeatedly rallied Third World leaders to campaign for representation in global organizations and redistribution through multilateral institutions. By decentering the United States and Europe in the history of global economic governance, Revolution in Development shows how Mexican economists, diplomats, and politicians fought for more than five decades to reform the rules and institutions of the global capitalist economy. In so doing, the book demonstrates, Mexican officials shaped not only their own domestic economic prospects but also the contours of the project of international development itself.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780520969636"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0520969634"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":310,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["History"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3gELEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3gELEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3gELEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA224&dq=sddf&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3gELEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3gELEAAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"NL","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":30.24,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amount":30.24,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3gELEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-3gELEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":30240000,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":30240000,"currencyCode":"EUR"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"NL","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.nl/books/download/Revolution_in_Development-sample-epub.acsm?id=3gELEAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.nl/books/download/Revolution_in_Development-sample-pdf.acsm?id=3gELEAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=3gELEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"... <b>SDDF</b> 710.

At this time, nations of the world are struggling to fashion a legal framework to govern Antarctic resources, which some regard as the common heritage of mankind. This debate, described vividly here, represents an ongoing application of the common-property resource concept, which has played a prominent role in RFF's research and analytical contributions during the past quarter-century. Furthermore, the continent's energy and minerals endowment-if exploitable at all (and in the author's judgment the prospects for this are dim)-constitute at best resources for the future.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781135993863"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1135993866"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":338,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Law"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.3.1.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=C5QuAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=C5QuAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=C5QuAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA278&dq=sddf&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=C5QuAgAAQBAJ&dq=sddf&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Seventh_Continent.html?hl=&id=C5QuAgAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"NL","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"NL","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.nl/books/download/The_Seventh_Continent-sample-pdf.acsm?id=C5QuAgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=C5QuAgAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"... <b>SDDF</b> , 031.11 Ellsworth Antarctic Expedition , document 94 ; and &quot; Ar- thur L.

Challener"],"publisher":"Princeton University Press","publishedDate":"2015-03-08","description":"After the Spanish-American War the United States, both by design and by accident, became involved in the Caribbean and the Far East on a scale that would have seemed highly improbable before 1898. As an \"emerging\" world power, the United States had to grapple with new issues, among them the role of military men and military power in protecting and advancing America's position in the world. Richard D. Challener has examined civil-military relationships in the period 1898-1914 to answer the following questions: To what extent did army and navy officers develop opinions on foreign policy issues? Were the admirals and generals consulted by the civilian officials of government, and did they participate in decision-making? How did the President and State Department use the military services in execution of foreign policy? Were military and diplomatic policy co-ordinated? Does an examination of these relationships help to assess either the interpretations of Kennan and the \"realists\" or Williams and the \"New Left\"? And ultimately, how effectively did the United States manage to reconcile force and diplomacy? This book sustains the case for interpreting 1898 and its aftermath as a deliberate search for an \"informal\" or \"insular\" empire and shows that American leaders, both civil and military, accepted an interventionist ethic.

The mathematical consequences of this transformation are demonstrated and it is proven that the new random variable N for the number of communicating civilizations in the Galaxy must follow the lognormal probability distribution when the number of factors in the Drake equation is allowed to increase at will. Mathematical SETI also studies the proposed FOCAL (Fast Outgoing Cyclopean Astronomical Lens) space mission to the nearest Sun Focal Sphere at 550 AU and describes its consequences for future interstellar precursor missions and truly interstellar missions. In addition the author shows how SETI signal processing may be dramatically improved by use of the Karhunen-Loève Transform (KLT) rather than Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

Focusing on the role of the Roosevelt administration and American Jewish leadership, Henry L. Feingold anchors the American reaction to the Holocaust in the tension-ridden domestic environment of the depression to the international scene. In these essays, he argues that the constraints of the American political system in the 1930s and 40s and the extraordinary events of the time virtually made it impossible for the administration and American Jews to react differently.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0815626703"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780815626701"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":340,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["History"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.6.7.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ts5lKWho2YwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ts5lKWho2YwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ts5lKWho2YwC&pg=PA284&dq=sddf&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ts5lKWho2YwC&dq=sddf&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Bearing_Witness.html?hl=&id=ts5lKWho2YwC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"NL","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"NL","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.nl/books/download/Bearing_Witness-sample-epub.acsm?id=ts5lKWho2YwC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.nl/books/download/Bearing_Witness-sample-pdf.acsm?id=ts5lKWho2YwC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ts5lKWho2YwC&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"... <b>SDDF</b> , 840.48 , Refugees / 2543 . 56.

Far from fostering democracy and social justice, foreign loans and aid were major impediments to these ideals. Symptomatic of systematic underdevelopment, cyclical Third World foreign borrowing and debt crises have been responsible for maintaining the debtor nations integrated into the global market economy, perpetuating their dependency, and maintaining low living standards. Comparing Colombia and Chile, the book examines the complex factors of domestic and international forces that account for structural underdevelopment in the Third World. A study on the historical antecedents of globalism and its impact on the Third World, this book analyzes the interplay between IMF, World Bank, and U.S. foreign policy in shaping the economies of the Third World through loans that are the catalyst to global integration. Through its in-depth look at a complex topic, this book will prove provocative and valuable reading to students of globalization, inter-American relations, international finance, Latin American History, and U.S. diplomatic history.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780313012181"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0313012180"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":257,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["History"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.0.1.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WbDOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WbDOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WbDOEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA190&dq=sddf&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WbDOEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WbDOEAAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"NL","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":86.25,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amount":60.37,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WbDOEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-WbDOEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":86250000,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":60370000,"currencyCode":"EUR"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"NL","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.nl/books/download/The_Sword_of_Damocles-sample-pdf.acsm?id=WbDOEAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=WbDOEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"... <b>SDDF</b> 821.10 / 6-756 , no . 865 . 32.

Drawing on extensive archival research in Mexico, the United States, and Great Britain, Christy Thornton meticulously traces how Mexican officials repeatedly rallied Third World leaders to campaign for representation in global organizations and redistribution through multilateral institutions. By decentering the United States and Europe in the history of global economic governance, Revolution in Development shows how Mexican economists, diplomats, and politicians fought for more than five decades to reform the rules and institutions of the global capitalist economy. In so doing, the book demonstrates, Mexican officials shaped not only their own domestic economic prospects but also the contours of the project of international development itself.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780520969636"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0520969634"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":310,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["History"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3gELEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3gELEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3gELEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA224&dq=sddf&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3gELEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3gELEAAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"NL","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":30.24,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amount":30.24,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3gELEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-3gELEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":30240000,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":30240000,"currencyCode":"EUR"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"NL","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.nl/books/download/Revolution_in_Development-sample-epub.acsm?id=3gELEAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.nl/books/download/Revolution_in_Development-sample-pdf.acsm?id=3gELEAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=3gELEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"... <b>SDDF</b> 710.

At this time, nations of the world are struggling to fashion a legal framework to govern Antarctic resources, which some regard as the common heritage of mankind. This debate, described vividly here, represents an ongoing application of the common-property resource concept, which has played a prominent role in RFF's research and analytical contributions during the past quarter-century. Furthermore, the continent's energy and minerals endowment-if exploitable at all (and in the author's judgment the prospects for this are dim)-constitute at best resources for the future.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781135993863"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1135993866"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":338,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Law"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.3.1.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=C5QuAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=C5QuAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=C5QuAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA278&dq=sddf&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=C5QuAgAAQBAJ&dq=sddf&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Seventh_Continent.html?hl=&id=C5QuAgAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"NL","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"NL","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.nl/books/download/The_Seventh_Continent-sample-pdf.acsm?id=C5QuAgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=C5QuAgAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"... <b>SDDF</b> , 031.11 Ellsworth Antarctic Expedition , document 94 ; and &quot; Ar- thur L.

Challener"],"publisher":"Princeton University Press","publishedDate":"2015-03-08","description":"After the Spanish-American War the United States, both by design and by accident, became involved in the Caribbean and the Far East on a scale that would have seemed highly improbable before 1898. As an \"emerging\" world power, the United States had to grapple with new issues, among them the role of military men and military power in protecting and advancing America's position in the world. Richard D. Challener has examined civil-military relationships in the period 1898-1914 to answer the following questions: To what extent did army and navy officers develop opinions on foreign policy issues? Were the admirals and generals consulted by the civilian officials of government, and did they participate in decision-making? How did the President and State Department use the military services in execution of foreign policy? Were military and diplomatic policy co-ordinated? Does an examination of these relationships help to assess either the interpretations of Kennan and the \"realists\" or Williams and the \"New Left\"? And ultimately, how effectively did the United States manage to reconcile force and diplomacy? This book sustains the case for interpreting 1898 and its aftermath as a deliberate search for an \"informal\" or \"insular\" empire and shows that American leaders, both civil and military, accepted an interventionist ethic.

The mathematical consequences of this transformation are demonstrated and it is proven that the new random variable N for the number of communicating civilizations in the Galaxy must follow the lognormal probability distribution when the number of factors in the Drake equation is allowed to increase at will. Mathematical SETI also studies the proposed FOCAL (Fast Outgoing Cyclopean Astronomical Lens) space mission to the nearest Sun Focal Sphere at 550 AU and describes its consequences for future interstellar precursor missions and truly interstellar missions. In addition the author shows how SETI signal processing may be dramatically improved by use of the Karhunen-Loève Transform (KLT) rather than Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Finally, he describes the efforts made to persuade the United Nations to make the central part of the Moon Far Side a UN-protected zone, in order to preserve the unique radio-noise-free environment for future scientific use.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9783642274374"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"3642274374"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":757,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Science"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"3.5.3.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cuJMzvdIWMcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cuJMzvdIWMcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cuJMzvdIWMcC&pg=PA202&dq=sddf&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cuJMzvdIWMcC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cuJMzvdIWMcC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"NL","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":163.49,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amount":114.44,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cuJMzvdIWMcC&rdid=book-cuJMzvdIWMcC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":163490000,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":114440000,"currencyCode":"EUR"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"NL","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.nl/books/download/Mathematical_SETI-sample-pdf.acsm?id=cuJMzvdIWMcC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=cuJMzvdIWMcC&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"... <b>sddF</b> bF ) sF + sddF2 + bF · <b>sddF</b> ( sddFbF ) sF – bF · <b>sddF</b> + bF2 The value of μ for the b - lognormal of the French Empire as derived from the two values of senility and death : sdμF = 5.507 σ S d √d - bvs - b Let us define the&nbsp;..."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"ts5lKWho2YwC","etag":"sAqTH7fZfiM","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ts5lKWho2YwC","volumeInfo":{"title":"Bearing Witness","subtitle":"How America and Its Jews Responded to the Holocaust","authors":["Henry L.

Focusing on the role of the Roosevelt administration and American Jewish leadership, Henry L. Feingold anchors the American reaction to the Holocaust in the tension-ridden domestic environment of the depression to the international scene. In these essays, he argues that the constraints of the American political system in the 1930s and 40s and the extraordinary events of the time virtually made it impossible for the administration and American Jews to react differently.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0815626703"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780815626701"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":340,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["History"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.6.7.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ts5lKWho2YwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ts5lKWho2YwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ts5lKWho2YwC&pg=PA284&dq=sddf&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ts5lKWho2YwC&dq=sddf&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Bearing_Witness.html?hl=&id=ts5lKWho2YwC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"NL","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"NL","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.nl/books/download/Bearing_Witness-sample-epub.acsm?id=ts5lKWho2YwC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.nl/books/download/Bearing_Witness-sample-pdf.acsm?id=ts5lKWho2YwC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ts5lKWho2YwC&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"... <b>SDDF</b> , 840.48 , Refugees / 2543 . 56.

Substantial investments have been made to map customer journeys, identify pain points and improve CX to try and create cut-through. Using real world applications to introduce next generation design tools based on proven concepts from strategy, marketing, psychology and creative problem solving, Lean CX: How to Differentiate at Low Cost and Least Risk discusses how to use Lean Management approaches to innovate your customer experience. This practical book describes how the tools from Lean Management can be applied to the CX innovation problem. The authors draw on hundreds of CX design and strategic innovation projects across a range of industries, both B2B and B2C, from primary research through client work and secondary case studies available in the public domain. The examples include many different vertical industry sectors, including those involving hybrid business models. The cases included share what worked really well and where CX failed. The content goes beyond what actually happened to present an idea of what might be possible with the right design approach and committed resources.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9783110683929"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"311068392X"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":238,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NAsqEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NAsqEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NAsqEAAAQBAJ&pg=PR19&dq=cx&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NAsqEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NAsqEAAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"NL","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":43.55,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amount":43.55,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NAsqEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-NAsqEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":43550000,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":43550000,"currencyCode":"EUR"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"NL","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.nl/books/download/Lean_CX-sample-pdf.acsm?id=NAsqEAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=NAsqEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"... <b>CX</b> Revenue Upsides 5 1.2 <b>CX</b> Cost Improvements 7 2.1 Votizen Pivots 38 3.1 Pirate Metrics 49 3.2 Innovation Metrics 62 4.1 Purchase Intention Accuracy 68 4.2 DISC and CAPFUL 78 4.3 TERMS Examples 4.4 Generic <b>CX</b> Design Matrix 82 4.5&nbsp;..."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"IzUVEQAAQBAJ","etag":"NRxgOI0+tTg","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/IzUVEQAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"How to create an exceptional B2B CX for success in a versatile market","authors":["Digital World"],"publisher":"Digital World","publishedDate":"2024-07-05","description":"Tired of mediocre sales results?

Substantial investments have been made to map customer journeys, identify pain points and improve CX to try and create cut-through. Using real world applications to introduce next generation design tools based on proven concepts from strategy, marketing, psychology and creative problem solving, Lean CX: How to Differentiate at Low Cost and Least Risk discusses how to use Lean Management approaches to innovate your customer experience. This practical book describes how the tools from Lean Management can be applied to the CX innovation problem.

Members of this species vary from very pathogenic agents causing different types of diseases including meningitis, gastroenteritis, and septicemia, just to cite a few, to harmless organisms living in the intestines of both humans and animals. E. coli has also been used as a model organism for most bacteria except a few. For this reason, its study provides a huge advantage and can help understand the mechanisms involved in different processes such as pathogenesis, environmental disinfection, nutrient utilization, antibiotic resistance, and diagnostic/detection methods, and these are indeed the topics discussed in this book. The book has been divided into four main sections representing the different facets of E. coli applications, which include disease, biotechnology, environmental engineering and innovative approaches to detection, and lastly its physiology and cell biology. Such processes can be applied to the study of other organisms as well considering the development of diversity; for example, many organisms are capable of horizontal gene transfer, which is capable of increasing the fitness of the bacterial organisms involved and has a great impact on the control of such bacterial organism.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9789535133292"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"9535133292"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":436,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Medical"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.2.3.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0jehDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0jehDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0jehDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA372&dq=cxxc&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0jehDwAAQBAJ&dq=cxxc&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Escherichia_coli.html?hl=&id=0jehDwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"NL","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"NL","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.nl/books/download/Escherichia_coli-sample-pdf.acsm?id=0jehDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=0jehDwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"... <b>CXXC</b>-containing proteins comprises the remaining 3900 proteins, of which ~63% are cytoplasmic, ~23% are transmembrane, and ~14% are secreted (omitted from Table 2).

The fields which have contrib uted to this area range from Clinical Medicine and Genetics to Biochemistry and Chemistry. The aim of this book is to bring together investigators from these diverse fields to reflect on the broad implications of direct and indirect interactions of metals and genetic components. The volume begins with a tribute to the late Karen Wetterhahn, an outstanding scien tist in the field, who will be sadly missed by her friends and colleagues because of her un timely death. The book has 28 chapters contributed by scientists who are internationally known for their expertise and outstanding research. The subject matters are divided into five major sections. The first section discusses genetic response to environmental expo sure to metals. Potentially devastating health crises have been reported in recent years from several parts of the world, which stem from environmental exposure to metals. In this section, authors report their findings on the effects and influence of metals in gene ex pression and their consequences to human health. The section on metal carcinogenesis and metal caused DNA damage, presents the latest advances in our knowledge of the molecu lar mechanisms of metal-induced mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. This topic is at the very heart of our understanding of how cancer may be caused by various metals.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781461547235"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1461547237"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":395,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Medical"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.2.2.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nAXTBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nAXTBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nAXTBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA294&dq=cxxc&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nAXTBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nAXTBwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"NL","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":54.49,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amount":38.14,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nAXTBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-nAXTBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":54490000,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":38140000,"currencyCode":"EUR"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"NL","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.nl/books/download/Metals_and_Genetics-sample-pdf.acsm?id=nAXTBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=nAXTBwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Bibudhendra Sarkar. m1 SxxS <b>CxxC CxxC CxxC CxxC CxxC</b> m1-3 SxxS SxxS SxxS <b>CxxC CxxC CxxC</b> m6 <b>CxxC CxxC CxxC CxxC CxxC</b> SxxS m4-6 <b>CxxC CxxC CxxC</b> SxxS SxxS SxxS m1-6 SxxS SxxS SxxS SxxS SxxS Sxxs Figure 2.

It is uniquely concerned with the molecular basis of major human diseases and disease processes, presented in the context of traditional pathology, with implications for translational molecular medicine. The Second Edition of Molecular Pathology has been thoroughly updated to reflect seven years of exponential changes in the fields of genetics, molecular, and cell biology which molecular pathology translates in the practice of molecular medicine. The textbook is intended to serve as a multi-use textbook that would be appropriate as a classroom teaching tool for biomedical graduate students, medical students, allied health students, and others (such as advanced undergraduates). Further, this textbook will be valuable for pathology residents and other postdoctoral fellows that desire to advance their understanding of molecular mechanisms of disease beyond what they learned in medical/graduate school. In addition, this textbook is useful as a reference book for practicing basic scientists and physician scientists that perform disease-related basic science and translational research, who require a ready information resource on the molecular basis of various human diseases and disease states. - Explores the principles and practice of molecular pathology: molecular pathogenesis, molecular mechanisms of disease, and how the molecular pathogenesis of disease parallels the evolution of the disease - Explains the practice of \"molecular medicine and the translational aspects of molecular pathology - Teaches from the perspective of \"integrative systems biology - Enhanced digital version included with purchase","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780128027875"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0128027878"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":805,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Medical"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.5.4.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BfVeBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BfVeBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BfVeBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA512&dq=cxxc&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BfVeBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BfVeBwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"NL","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":150.42,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amount":105.29,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BfVeBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-BfVeBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":150420000,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":105290000,"currencyCode":"EUR"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"NL","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.nl/books/download/Molecular_Pathology-sample-epub.acsm?id=BfVeBwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.nl/books/download/Molecular_Pathology-sample-pdf.acsm?id=BfVeBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=BfVeBwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"... <b>CXXC</b> - X29- <b>CXXC CXXC</b> - X29- <b>CXXC</b> CR1 CR2 1 15/16 37/38 98 HPV16 E7 LXCXE - X29- <b>CXXC</b> RB1 / RBL1 / RBL2 binding PDZ binding sequences separated by 29 amino acids .

Members of this species vary from very pathogenic agents causing different types of diseases including meningitis, gastroenteritis, and septicemia, just to cite a few, to harmless organisms living in the intestines of both humans and animals. E. coli has also been used as a model organism for most bacteria except a few. For this reason, its study provides a huge advantage and can help understand the mechanisms involved in different processes such as pathogenesis, environmental disinfection, nutrient utilization, antibiotic resistance, and diagnostic/detection methods, and these are indeed the topics discussed in this book. The book has been divided into four main sections representing the different facets of E. coli applications, which include disease, biotechnology, environmental engineering and innovative approaches to detection, and lastly its physiology and cell biology. Such processes can be applied to the study of other organisms as well considering the development of diversity; for example, many organisms are capable of horizontal gene transfer, which is capable of increasing the fitness of the bacterial organisms involved and has a great impact on the control of such bacterial organism.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9789535133292"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"9535133292"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":436,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Medical"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.2.3.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0jehDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0jehDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0jehDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA372&dq=cxxc&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0jehDwAAQBAJ&dq=cxxc&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Escherichia_coli.html?hl=&id=0jehDwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"NL","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"NL","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.nl/books/download/Escherichia_coli-sample-pdf.acsm?id=0jehDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=0jehDwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"... <b>CXXC</b>-containing proteins comprises the remaining 3900 proteins, of which ~63% are cytoplasmic, ~23% are transmembrane, and ~14% are secreted (omitted from Table 2).

The fields which have contrib uted to this area range from Clinical Medicine and Genetics to Biochemistry and Chemistry. The aim of this book is to bring together investigators from these diverse fields to reflect on the broad implications of direct and indirect interactions of metals and genetic components. The volume begins with a tribute to the late Karen Wetterhahn, an outstanding scien tist in the field, who will be sadly missed by her friends and colleagues because of her un timely death. The book has 28 chapters contributed by scientists who are internationally known for their expertise and outstanding research. The subject matters are divided into five major sections. The first section discusses genetic response to environmental expo sure to metals. Potentially devastating health crises have been reported in recent years from several parts of the world, which stem from environmental exposure to metals. In this section, authors report their findings on the effects and influence of metals in gene ex pression and their consequences to human health. The section on metal carcinogenesis and metal caused DNA damage, presents the latest advances in our knowledge of the molecu lar mechanisms of metal-induced mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. This topic is at the very heart of our understanding of how cancer may be caused by various metals.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781461547235"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1461547237"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":395,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Medical"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.2.2.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nAXTBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nAXTBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nAXTBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA294&dq=cxxc&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nAXTBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nAXTBwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"NL","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":54.49,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amount":38.14,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nAXTBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-nAXTBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":54490000,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":38140000,"currencyCode":"EUR"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"NL","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.nl/books/download/Metals_and_Genetics-sample-pdf.acsm?id=nAXTBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=nAXTBwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Bibudhendra Sarkar. m1 SxxS <b>CxxC CxxC CxxC CxxC CxxC</b> m1-3 SxxS SxxS SxxS <b>CxxC CxxC CxxC</b> m6 <b>CxxC CxxC CxxC CxxC CxxC</b> SxxS m4-6 <b>CxxC CxxC CxxC</b> SxxS SxxS SxxS m1-6 SxxS SxxS SxxS SxxS SxxS Sxxs Figure 2.

Tsongalis"],"publisher":"Academic Press","publishedDate":"2017-11-09","description":"As the molecular basis of human disease becomes better characterized, and the implications for understanding the molecular basis of disease becomes realized through improved diagnostics and treatment, Molecular Pathology, Second Edition stands out as the most comprehensive textbook where molecular mechanisms represent the focus. It is uniquely concerned with the molecular basis of major human diseases and disease processes, presented in the context of traditional pathology, with implications for translational molecular medicine. The Second Edition of Molecular Pathology has been thoroughly updated to reflect seven years of exponential changes in the fields of genetics, molecular, and cell biology which molecular pathology translates in the practice of molecular medicine. The textbook is intended to serve as a multi-use textbook that would be appropriate as a classroom teaching tool for biomedical graduate students, medical students, allied health students, and others (such as advanced undergraduates). Further, this textbook will be valuable for pathology residents and other postdoctoral fellows that desire to advance their understanding of molecular mechanisms of disease beyond what they learned in medical/graduate school. In addition, this textbook is useful as a reference book for practicing basic scientists and physician scientists that perform disease-related basic science and translational research, who require a ready information resource on the molecular basis of various human diseases and disease states. - Explores the principles and practice of molecular pathology: molecular pathogenesis, molecular mechanisms of disease, and how the molecular pathogenesis of disease parallels the evolution of the disease - Explains the practice of \"molecular medicine and the translational aspects of molecular pathology - Teaches from the perspective of \"integrative systems biology - Enhanced digital version included with purchase","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780128027875"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0128027878"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":805,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Medical"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.5.4.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BfVeBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BfVeBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BfVeBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA512&dq=cxxc&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BfVeBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BfVeBwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"NL","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":150.42,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amount":105.29,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BfVeBwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-BfVeBwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":150420000,"currencyCode":"EUR"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":105290000,"currencyCode":"EUR"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"NL","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.nl/books/download/Molecular_Pathology-sample-epub.acsm?id=BfVeBwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.nl/books/download/Molecular_Pathology-sample-pdf.acsm?id=BfVeBwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=BfVeBwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"... <b>CXXC</b> - X29- <b>CXXC CXXC</b> - X29- <b>CXXC</b> CR1 CR2 1 15/16 37/38 98 HPV16 E7 LXCXE - X29- <b>CXXC</b> RB1 / RBL1 / RBL2 binding PDZ binding sequences separated by 29 amino acids .
